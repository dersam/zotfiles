Installation
* Run zot.sh (it will alias itself to `zot` after the first run).
* oh-my-zsh is required.

TODO
* Autoinstall oh-my-zsh if not present
* Improve color handling so formatting.sh is totally compatible with dane's bash dotfiles
* standardize command prefixes so it's not an unrememberable jumble of names
* improve the abstraction of usables in the staples theme.
